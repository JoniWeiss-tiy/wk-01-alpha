    <h2>Audition Pic for Cherry Bomb, a Joan Jett Cover Band</h2>
    <p>
      A friend went with me to support me while I auditioned for this band. That's where I met Chris DeCaria, with whom I would collaborate with in 2 other bands after this one. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_Bomb_(The_Runaways_song)">Here is a link to a wiki page about the song, Cherry Bomb</a>
