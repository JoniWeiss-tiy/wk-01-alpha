      <h1>Joni&quot;s Short Band Herstory</h1>
      <p>
        I've been playing drums off and on since high school. However it was only when I renewed my interest in playing in 2006 that I actually joined bands. From 2006 until 2013 I was nearly continuously engaged in forming and practicing with bands, with a few cherished performances scattered here and there. This is just a taste of my band herstory. Enjoy :)

    <h2 id="cherry-bomb">Audition Pic for Cherry Bomb, a Joan Jett Cover Band</h2>
    <p>
      A friend went with me to support me while I auditioned for this band. That's where I met Chris DeCaria, with whom I would collaborate with in 2 other bands after this one. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_Bomb_(The_Runaways_song)" target="_blank">Here is a link to a wiki page about the song, Cherry Bomb</a>

    <p>
      Chris brought me into my next band which we named Stella!!!. We had a lot of fun playing together. We practiced a lot, and practiced performing at a club in O-Town every week for a while. We have the notoriety of becoming the very first all-female rock band to ever perform at the Alta Club in downtown SLC. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alta_Club" target="_blank">Here is a link to a wiki page about the Alta Club</a>
