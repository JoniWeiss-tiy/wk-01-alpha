        I've been playing drums off and on since high school. However it was only when I renewed my interest in playing in 2006 that I actually joined bands. From 2006 until 2013 I was nearly continuously engaged in forming and practicing with bands, with a few cherished performances scattered here and there. This is just a taste of my band herstory. Enjoy :)

          <h2>Cherry Bomb</h2>
          <p>
            Once I auditioned for a Joan Jett Cover Band called Cherry Bomb. That's where I met Chris DeCaria, with whom I would collaborate with in 2 other bands after this one. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_Bomb_(The_Runaways_song)" target="_blank">Here is a link to a wiki page about the song, Cherry Bomb</a>

            <li>Also got to learn some Ramones stuff</li>

            Chris brought me into my next band which we named Stella!!!. We had a lot of fun playing together. We practiced a lot, and practiced performing at a club in O-Town every week for a while. We have the notoriety of becoming the very first all-female rock band to ever perform at the Alta Club in downtown SLC. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alta_Club" target="_blank">Here is a link to a wiki page about the Alta Club</a>

          <h2>Garage Fire Band</h2>
          <p>
            The last band I was in as drummer. This time I invited Chris to join us. We ended up naming this band The Garage Fire Band after... (remember when The Garage On Beck caught on fire? Well, we needed a name for our band and then that happened and boom!)<a href="http://www.slugmag.com/show-reviews/shes-a-lady-fest-2012-edition-free-speech-zone-07-14/">Slug Magazine covered the LadyFest which included mention of our band.. yay :)</a>
